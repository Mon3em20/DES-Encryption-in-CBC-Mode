# DES-Encryption-in-CBC-Mode
DES Encryption in CBC Mode â€“ Python Project
Implemented the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm from scratch in Python, processing 64-bit blocks through 16 encryption rounds.

Developed each DES round including expansion, key mixing (XOR), substitution (S-box), and permutation stages, with output tracing at each step.

Extended the implementation to support full-message encryption using CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, managing padding and IV chaining for security.

Utilized helper tools and tables for key scheduling and bit-level operations, demonstrating hands-on experience in cryptographic system design.
